## Examples

All the examples are available in the [examples folder](./examples/)

## Libraries

- [Mercurius Codegen](./packages/mercurius-codegen/) - Integration with [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to get automatic type-safety and autocompletion.

## Contributing

This project uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)

But the examples are just basic Node.js packages, but for development and to test them yourself, you will need to [install it](https://pnpm.io/installation) and then execute

```bash
pnpm i
```

To install all the required dependencies

And then execute:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To tests all the projects
