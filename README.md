## Contributing

This project uses [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.js.org/en/workspaces)

But the examples are just basic Node.js packages, but for development and to test them yourself you will need to [install it](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation) and then simply execute

```bash
pnpm i
```

To install all the required dependencies

And then execute:

```bash
pnpm test
```

To tests all the projects
